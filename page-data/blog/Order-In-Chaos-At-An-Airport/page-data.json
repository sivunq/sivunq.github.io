They’re a mix of chaos and order, full of stories colliding in real time hellos, goodbyes, nerves, excitement, and a surprising amount of people-watching material. While waiting for my flight, I found myself observing the little dramas, habits, and quirks unfolding around me. What I saw was a snapshot of humanity, all compressed into a single terminal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Airports probably have the highest density of cute and fashionable people… like everyone got a memo that this was a runway show.</li>\n<li><strong>Class divide:</strong> economy vs business, priority vs normal boarding, basically rich people vs the rest of us pretending to be patient.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Emotions flying everywhere:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Families reuniting like a Bollywood climax.</li>\n<li>Families separating like a daily soap opera.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>People <em>pretending</em> to work on laptops aka staring at Excel sheets while scrolling Instagram.</li>\n<li>People actually working on laptops… RIP to their work-life balance.</li>\n<li>The WFH warriors secretly traveling without telling their team “Sorry guys, bad Wi-Fi” while sipping mojito at the airport lounge.</li>\n<li>First-time fliers: some look terrified, some look like they just won the lottery.</li>\n<li>Middle-class kids flexing hard by taking their parents on a flight, their proud faces could power the runway lights.</li>\n<li>People walking around acting 20% cooler than they actually are, sunglasses inside, of course.</li>\n<li>Half the crowd debating whether that ₹400 coffee is worth it or not. Spoiler: they’ll buy it anyway.</li>\n<li>Luggage check: trying to guess people’s net worth by their bags and wondering what <em>you</em> are doing wrong with your life.</li>\n<li>Kids screaming like they’re auditioning for a horror movie, both at the airport and mid-air.</li>\n<li>Sleep-deprived zombies everywhere. Basically, the terminal is one giant group yawn.</li>\n<li>Uncles watching WhatsApp videos on full volume without earphones, national nuisance since 2010.</li>\n<li>The “business trip cool kids” carrying only a laptop bag like they own Wall Street.</li>\n<li>Newlyweds being disgustingly cute, definitely en route to their honeymoon.</li>\n<li>Confused foreigners looking around like they opened the wrong video game map.</li>\n<li>That one aunty on the phone narrating every move: “Haanji, abhi boarding ho rahi hai… abhi gate pe khadi hoon…” (entire terminal knows her status).</li>\n<li>A couple with a baby… but they themselves look like they just finished 12th grade.</li>\n<li>All those 10/10s you’ll spot once, fall in love with for 5 seconds, and never see again. Pain.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>And finally, me:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chose to board the flight instead of shooting my shot with that cute girl.</li>\n<li>Flying economy, normal boarding, because… reality check.</li>\n<li>Didn’t bother standing in line. Sat back, watched the chaos, and joined when the line disappeared like a pro.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Going to board now.
