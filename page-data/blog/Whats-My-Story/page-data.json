A lot of different cultures in one sentence, right ?</p>\n<p>Currently, I work at <a href=\"https://www.zestmoney.in/\"><strong>Zestmoney</strong></a>, as a SDE-2.</p>\n<h2>What about my free¬†time ?</h2>\n<p>I like to choose activities which add value to the world, be that to someone else or to me. I try to refrain from things which drain my energy, make me feel bad or does not align with my long term vision. I fail at this sometimes though, but I am trying my best.</p>\n<p>I really enjoy reading, usually non-fiction, for example. If a book catches my attention, I will put it on my list, no matter the topic. However, my favorites are about psychology, business, self-improvement, coding, finance, history, and health. I like to read only one book at a time and learn about the given topic from a couple of different sources.</p>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Want to know more about me? Don‚Äôt be shy and reach out to me on any of the socials listed on the homepage. I am always up for interesting discussions!</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading! üôè</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What's my story ?","date":"January 10, 2021","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/fe52c60a921cf681b82277b452ef5882/2244e/whats-my-story-cover.jpg"}}},"slug":"whats-my-story","description":"This post will give you a better understanding of the content I am going to put out and the ideas I am going to express.","category":"Personal","tags":["Travel","Storytime","Personal Growth"]},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Whats-My-Story/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Hello-World/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/How-I-Managed-And-Scheduled-My-Distractions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I Managed And Scheduled My Distractions"}}}},
